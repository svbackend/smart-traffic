# smart-traffic

Trying to make traffic lights' logic smarter by using cameras and cars/pedestrians detection, system, based on information received from cameras, will decide which road line should be in prority, as well as would save some time for pedestrians when there's no cars and vice-versa. This repository will contain only "proof of concept" code with no real data, only simulation on virtual map with virtual cars and pedestrians, but if it would really helpful I will try to bring this project to real life. Example below:
